# mapping-robot
Project for Embedded Systems class (ECEN 361) in Winter 2024. Group members include Trevor Gibb, and Adam Foster.

* The navigation algorithm can be found in nav_algorithm.pdf. This algorithm is found in Project > Ultrasonic.h > obstacleAvoidanceMode().
* Some of this code was provided to us from the manufacturer by the robot. Due to limited time and team members, we didn't have time to do some things, like learn about the calculations associated with the gyroscope and sensors.
